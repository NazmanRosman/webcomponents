            Ok ok, so not that kind of experiment. But still..

Welcome to IST 402, [your semester] 20xx!
This is the 6th time I have gotten to teach at the university and I hope that regardless of the bizarre times we live in that we'll be able to have fun and make the most of it learning a "new" technology called Web Components .

While first mentioned in 2011, the standard didn't gain major adoption until almost 2018 when Safari and Firefox both adopted the four standards required to make the technology viable. Edge soon switched to Chromium under the hood and in the span of about 8 months we went from 70% of traffic natively understanding ES6 web components to 92%!

While in the past there may have been fundamental technical limitations as to why NOT to adopt web components, there is no longer a barrier at the end-user level. My team started adopting web components in 2017 just before the major upswing in acceptance. Lots of early sweat equity has lead to us being on the forefront of a new renaissance in how the web is created and shared.

Now, you may have read this and went "yeah but I am taking the Micro Frontend course" and do I have news for you... A popular way to build micro frontends is with web components! This course will involve building and documenting APIs and backends, but the front-end way that users interface with your project will be via web components. If you love this course then you'll enjoy the other; they are meant to compliment each other and can be taken in either order as there's minimal overlap because of the focus.

Join The joker in unpacking all the tools and technologies required to develop the future that we can all share in!
